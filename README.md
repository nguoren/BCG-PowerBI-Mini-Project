## Introduction: Global Automotive Seating Company
- Major supplier of seating systems for automobiles across the world with 200+ seat manufacturing plants in 30+ countries
- 25 million cars equipped annually

## Business Problem
- Decline in profits over time due to steep increase in operating costs of the manufacturing plants
- Lack of visibility in the production process leading to ineffective operational process which increase costs
  1. Machine Downtime
  2. Products Defect Rate

## Objective
#### a. Business Objective
- Incorporate real time diagnostics of plant operational process to better manage available production lines and increase profit margin
- Use data and analytics to track production process of various machines in real time to provide better visibility of the seat manufacturing process
#### b. Analytics Objective
- Build an analytics dashboard to track plant's operational process ie. downtime minutes, total machine utilisation time, etc.

## KPI of Manufacturing Plant

No. | KPI | Description
--- | --- | ---
| 1. | Machine Utilisation | Helps engineers in understanding idle time of machines to maximise on the total production time |
| 2. | Right First Time | Helps in identifying machines that are taking multiple iterations to get the final product |
| 3. | Scrap Rate | Machines generally should produce more of the final product and less of any scrap pieces |
| 4. | Downtime Minutes | Helps engineers in identifying machines that are prone to failure and maintenance |
| 5. | Rework Rate | Helps in identifying which products and machines need more reworks on the final products |
| 6. | Production Pieces | Total Production Pieces vs Expected Total Production. Helps in identifying which machines have been working at full capacity and producing high quality final products |
